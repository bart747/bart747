Contrasts are one of key elements when it comes to usability. Lets take coins as an example.

When it comes to look: at first glance you see differences in size, color (types of metals) and visual patterns.

Feel in hand: some seem heavier, some lighter, some have different surfaces.

Some of these things will help you in one situation, some in another. It's good that they exist.

By analogy, you can do something similar with interfaces.
Font sizes of titles (h1, h2, h3) are well known, trivial example.
Forms are more tricky.

Sign-up and sign-in forms often look similar and appear in similar places.
To create a useful contrasts, we can give them different titles and labels.

“Create an account” will make a better title than “Sign up” when there's also “Sign in”.
“Log in” will be better then “Sign in” if you want to stay with “Sign up”.

When it comes to input labels, “Your password” and “Create a password” are usefully different.

Users will see the difference without careful reading.
