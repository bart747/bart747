title: "Learning UI Design from Coins (on Contrast)"

Contrasts are one of key elements when it comes to usability. Lets take coins as an example.

When it comes to look: at first glance you see differences in size, color (types of metals) and visual patterns.

Feel in hand: some seem heavier, some lighter, some have different surfaces.

Some of these things will help you in one situation, some in another. It's good that they exist.

By analogy, you can do something similar with interfaces.
Font sizes of titles (h1, h2, h3) are well known, trivial example.
Forms are more tricky.

Sign-up and sign-in forms often look similar and appear in similar places.
To create a useful contrasts, we can give them different titles and labels.
We need to remember that users should see what's going on without careful reading.

*Create an account* will make a better title than *Sign up*, when there's also *Sign in* on a page.
If you want to stay with *Sign up*, changing *Sign in* to *Log in* will be a good idea.

When it comes to input labels, *Your password* and *Create a password* are usefully different.
Way better than just *Password*.

Two different things need to seem different at first sight.
