title: "Persuasive Newsletter Sign-Up Forms: From a Reader's Point of View"

Putting newsletter sign-up forms into right attention spots is tricky. You don't
want to have one of "those marketing sites".
On the other hand, you want a solid funnel of potential clients.

When it comes to my experiences as a newsletter reader (and I don't think I'm
any original in this case), when I subscribe,
I do it after a couple of site visits.

First, I click a link to some article, video or podcast.
If the content is interesting enough to be remembered, I might visit the site again.
If I do visit it again, and I like what I get,
then I might be willing to subscribe and get it more regularly.

It's never any faster than that.

As a UI designer, I see two key elements in this problem:

1. timing,
2. copy.

## Timing 

Your form shouldn't be placed too high or too low in a hierarchy of content.
An article, or a podcast, or something like that should be the epicenter.
The form goes after that.

You show a little bit of what you represent.
You give valuable content for free. People are realizing it's good.
Than you ask for action.

That's why the place right below an article and the bottom of your 'about' page are
good for the newsletter form. 

## Copy 

The form copy should be a premise of unique value.

People should know that it's not just info about new blog posts.
They should know it's a good deal.

It's not likely that your visitors are afraid of being left behind
by not reading your posts. Many of them are also happy **un**-subscribers of some crappy newsletters. Why they should give it a try again.
