More often than not, research is something that prevents you from making a decision. 
You want to be sure, so you seek more.
But your brain is somehow full of doubts all the time &mdash; no matter what you know.

It's all about fear.

There are many UX techniques that you might think are necessary to make good work.
You think that you have to to this and that before you'll start programming.
You think you should have a clear picture in your head,
so when you starting to code you're sure it will be great.
All that is stupid.

It's much better to prototype fast &mdash; do something that barely works. That way your brain will get real data.
It's not just picture in your head.
It's clickable.
You can see actual performance.
And if it's something that you yourself need or have problem with,
you can judge it well. Than you make a decision and stop looking for crystal balls.
