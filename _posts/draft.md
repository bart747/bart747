Putting newsletter sign-up forms into right attention spots is tricky. You don't
want have one of "those marketing sites". On the other hand, you wan't big, well 
developed funnel of potential clients.

From my point of view&mdash;as UI designer&mdash; there are two 
key elements in this problem:
- timing
- copy

You want to put your form in the place that visitors will easily notice.
It should be *after* some greate piece of content, so it will not be proposition
from a total stranger.

You show a little bit of what you represent.
You give something valuable for free.
Than ask for action.

One of good places is below articles.
It means focus on production and presentation of great content. That content is free
value and presentation of yourself. Asking for sign-ups follows it.

The copy part is about telling about benefits of your newsletter. It means that
you don't just put a form with two descriptive sentences.
Something like "sing-up now and be inform about all new stuff we do".
What I'm writing about is more like bullet list's of benefits, unique value.
It's not just info about new blog posts.
