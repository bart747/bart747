## "X Technology Will Rule The World"

Of course, no one really knows the future,
but there are some pretty clear patterns worth exploring. 
One of them is human nature and Lindy Effect.
Powerful things when combined together. (Actually, they are tightly connected.)

Lindy Effects is a theory that says, in short, that the longer something exists, 
the more likely it will survive in the future. It's about things like
technology, books in print, old movies that people are still watching and
procrastination.

You can say that now we sell things on-line.
People can buy things using smartphones.
And anyone have one in his pocket. Ready to use.
That sounds like a big, surprising shift,
but actually it's an effect of a pretty boring process. 

Lets stick to that cable/antenna stuff (a phone and the Internet).
Since thousands of years we communicate and sell.
Once we figured out postal services, we communicate farther and sell farther.
Once we figured out a phone, we communicate more and deal with telemarketers.
Once we figured out the Internet, we get e-commerce, social
media and email.
Once many people got email address, we use them to communicate
with each other and sell at a big scale.
And once we know we can sell with it at low cost, we
overdo it.  

Take a look at successful SAAS businesses. I mean, those that make solid money. 
The top ones help you communicate, sell or both. Project management is communication.
CRM is both. Analytics software helps figuring out better sales channels.

People in SAAS like to use the word 'automation', but it's usually marketing
automation, transaction automation or client-business communication automation. 

Everything that can send a message at a big distance is
used to communicate and sell.

And it's something that supports our already present thinking patterns.
It's never like "reshape your brain or die".
Good new things are based on old, proven things. When they ignore the
past, they die.

When you see Google Maps, you know immediately, that it's a map. It looks similar
to the old ones. It could look different with todays technology, but would it be
better?

The touch keyboard in your smartphone looks similar to an old,
physical QWERTY.
It's in a different context, but good makers know that they shouldn't
confuse you. 

What a world. Nothing is fucking changing here.
